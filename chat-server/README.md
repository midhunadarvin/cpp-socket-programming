### Chat Server

In this version we would be communicating from client to client via a chat server

The chat server serves as the intermediatory to facilitate communication between 2 clients.

For simplicity, we will connect the second client that connects to the server to the first client
In real world, we would need to maintain the connection details via their unique ids or ips.
